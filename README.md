# API

This is my repository link for HW6 What's the Weather Like? material.

I utilized Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question in Part I of the assignment (WeatherPy): "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

A Jupyter Notebook was developed to address this challenge, as well that posed in Part II (VacationPy).

My overall observations as well as comments around each graph are provided in the Jupyter Notebook.

Thank you,

Steve Freeland
